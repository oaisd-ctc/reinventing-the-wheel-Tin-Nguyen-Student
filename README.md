In this project, we have tried to replicate the Math, Array, and String Class. For each class we tried to recreate diffrent functions within the classes such as Math.Pow, Math.Round, String.ToUpper, and Array.Avg. For each of these replicated classes we have designed Unit Tests for each function where it tests the function to see if the function will actually output the correct answers. In case for some reason your console does not allow you to use these built-in functions, you can use this NuGET package to do it for you!
